* Kill off the (huge quantity) of crap we don't need in the imw/ directory


* We need to set data partitioning as a design goal: make it easy to define a
  number of worker processes and a worker #, then have steps attempt to only
  do that specific fraction of the data.  (for ripd, how does this work? file
  glob on dl? insist on separate steps, and make a 'distribute' command? rip
  files probabilistically?)
