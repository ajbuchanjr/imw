# h2. etc/imwrc -- default site-wide imw configuration file
#
# == About
#
# This file contains the site-wide configuration settings for this
# installation of the Infinite Monkeywrench.  Settings here override
# the defaults in <tt>lib/imw/utils/config.rb</tt> (see the
# documentation for that file for more detail on the variables that
# can be configured here) but will in turn be overwritten by settings
# in the <tt>~/.imwrc</tt> file in each user's directory (though the
# location of this file can be customized).
#
# At the present moment, all settings are stored as plain Ruby files
# (though they may lack the <tt>.rb</tt> extension).  As the IMW
# develops, these will be replaced by YAML files which will be parsed
# by <tt>lib/imw/utils/config.rb</tt>.
