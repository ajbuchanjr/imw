# h2. lib/imw/utils/config.rb -- configuration parsing
#
# == About
#
# IMW looks for configuration settings in the following places, in
# order of increasing precedence:
#
#   1. Settings defined directly in this file.
#
#   2. From the <tt>etc/imwrc</tt> file in the IMW root directory.
#
#   3. From the <tt>.imwrc</tt> file in the user's home directory (the
#      filename can be changed; see
#      <tt>IMW::Config::USER_CONFIG_FILE_BASENAME</tt>).
#
#   4. From the file defined by the environment variable +IMWRC+ (the
#      value can be changed; see
#      <tt>IMW::Config::USER_CONFIG_FILE_ENV_VARIABLE</tt>
#
# Settings not found in one configuration location will be searched
# for in locations of lesser precedence.
#
# *Note:* configuration files are plain Ruby code that will be directly
# evaluated.
#
# Relevant settings include
#
# * interfaces with external programs (+tar+, +wget+, &c.)
# * paths to directories where IMW reads/writes files
# * correspondences between file extensions and IMW file classes
#
# For more detailed information, see the default configuration file,
# <tt>etc/imwrc</tt>.
